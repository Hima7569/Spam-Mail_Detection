# Spam-Mail_Detection
# This Python script demonstrates email spam detection using machine learning, employing SVM and Naive Bayes models. 
# It loads email data from a specified directory, preprocesses the text by tokenizing and removing stopwords, and converts it into TF-IDF features. 
# The data is then split for training and testing, and both models are trained and evaluated using classification metrics. 
# Finally, the trained models and TF-IDF vectorizer are saved for future use.
1. **Objective**: The code aims to develop a spam email detection system using machine learning techniques.
2. **Data Loading**: Emails are loaded from a specified directory, distinguishing between spam and ham based on file names.
3. **Preprocessing**: Text data undergoes tokenization, lowercase conversion, and stop word removal to clean the content.
4. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization is employed to convert text into numerical features for model training.
5. **Model Training**: Two models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes, are trained on the TF-IDF transformed data.
6. **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Predictions are made on the test set, and classification reports along with accuracy scores are generated for both models.
8. **Model Selection**: The SVM and Naive Bayes models are compared based on their accuracy and other classification metrics.
9. **Save Models**: Trained models along with the TF-IDF vectorizer are saved using the joblib library for future use.
10. **Efficiency**: SVM with a linear kernel is used due to its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.
11. **Model Comparison**: Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classifier, is chosen for comparison as it's simple yet powerful for text classification.
12. **Scalability**: TF-IDF vectorization limits features to the top 3000, ensuring computational efficiency and preventing overfitting.
13. **Data Integrity**: Unicode errors during data loading are handled by ignoring problematic characters, ensuring smooth processing.
14. **Data Exploration**: Prior data exploration, such as checking for class imbalances, is assumed to have been performed for model reliability.
15. **Readability**: The code is well-commented and structured into functions for readability and modularity.
16. **Dependencies**: Required libraries such as pandas, nltk, scikit-learn, and joblib are listed for environment setup.
17. **Model Deployment**: The trained models can be deployed in production environments for real-time spam detection.
18. **Documentation**: The code is intended for use in Jupyter Notebooks and is accompanied by this README file for context and understanding.
19. **Future Work**: Further enhancements could include hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, or deep learning models for improved accuracy.
20. **Contributions**: Contributions, feedback, and enhancements are welcome to refine and optimize the spam detection system.
